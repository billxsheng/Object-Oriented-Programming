//        Each house has an address (REFERENCE)
//        You can copy that reference as many times but there is still only one house
//        We can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods


//        House blueHouse = new House("blue");
//        House anotherHouse = blueHouse;
//        This creates a reference to the same object in memory

//        anotherHouse.setColor("yellow");
//        both house references have the same color because both houses are pointing to the same object

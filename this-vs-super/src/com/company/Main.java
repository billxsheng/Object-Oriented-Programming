//        this is used to call the current class members (variables and methods)
//        required when we have a parameter that has the same name as the field

//        note that we can use both of them anywhere in a class except static areas


//        method overriding is when we call a method with the same name from the parent class

//        this() is used with constructor chaining and must be the first line in the constructor
//        super() calls the parent constructor also the first statement
//        a call cannot call this() and super()
